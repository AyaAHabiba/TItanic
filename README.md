# Titanic
## Introduction
**This repository contains my solution for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. In this competition, the task is to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and so on.**
## Files

* train.csv: This file contains the training dataset, which includes features and the target variable (Survived).
* test.csv: This file contains the test dataset, which includes only features. The goal is to predict the survival outcomes for these passengers.
* submission.csv: This is the submission file format required by Kaggle. It includes PassengerId and the predicted survival outcomes.

## Data Exploration
Before building any predictive model, it's important to explore the data to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. Some key points from the data exploration process include:

Understanding the distribution of the target variable (Survived).
Analyzing the relationships between features and the target variable.
Handling missing values and outliers appropriately.
Visualizing the data using plots and charts to identify patterns.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the performance of machine learning models. In this competition, I performed various feature engineering techniques such as:

Creating new features based on existing ones.
Handling categorical variables through encoding techniques.
Dealing with missing values by imputation or other strategies.
Scaling or normalizing numerical features if necessary.
Model Selection
For this classification task, I experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
```
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machines
RandomForestClassifier
Linear SVC
Stochastic Gradient Descent
```

I evaluated each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy.

## Results
After training the model, I achieved the following results:

Kaggle leaderboard score: 77%
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques for classification tasks. The experience gained from participating in this competition helped me enhance my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
